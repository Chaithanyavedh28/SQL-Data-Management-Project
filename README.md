# SQL Data Management Project

This project demonstrates the application of SQL to design and implement a structured data solution that supports efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of operational data.

## Project Overview
The project focuses on understanding raw data, identifying relationships, and designing an optimized schema using SQL. It includes database creation, constraints, indexing, complex queries, views, and stored procedures.

## Key Skills Used
- Database Design & ER Modelling  
- SQL DDL (CREATE, ALTER)  
- SQL DML (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)  
- JOINS, GROUP BY, HAVING  
- Subqueries & Aggregate Functions  
- Views & Stored Procedures  
- Indexing & Query Optimization  
- Transaction Control (COMMIT, ROLLBACK)

## Files Included
- `schema.sql` — Database tables & constraints  
- `data.sql` — Sample data  
- `queries.sql` — Reporting, analytics & optimization queries  

## Summary
This project showcases my ability to design normalized tables, enforce data integrity, write efficient queries, and extract actionable insights from structured data.
